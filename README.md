## 🚀 About Me  
Hi! I’m Anshita, a **Software Engineer** who thrives on solving complex problems and transforming ideas into scalable, high-performing systems. My journey in technology began with a fascination for building solutions that not only work but excel under real-world constraints. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in designing **robust architectures** and crafting user-centric applications that leave a measurable impact.  

I’ve worked extensively with **React.js**, **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, **MongoDB**, **ElasticSearch**, and **AWS** services like **Cognito**, **SNS**, **SES**, and **Elastic Beanstalk** to create systems that are scalable, secure, and globally adaptable. My expertise includes **microservices architecture**, **real-time communication (Socket.IO)**, and implementing **localization** features that enhance user engagement by over 35%.  

One of my key achievements includes engineering payment systems using **Stripe** and **PayPal**, driving a 60% revenue increase while ensuring secure and seamless transactions for users. I’ve also streamlined CI/CD pipelines using **GitHub Actions**, **Jenkins**, and **CircleCI**, enabling faster, consistent releases. Additionally, I’ve optimized application performance with tools like **Webpack**, reducing bundle sizes by 20%, and ensured reliability through rigorous testing frameworks such as **Jest**, **JUnit**, and **Mockito**.  

When I’m not optimizing code or streamlining workflows, I’m exploring emerging technologies like **GraphQL**, **Kubernetes**, and **Serverless Computing**, always looking for innovative ways to push boundaries. I believe that behind every line of code is an opportunity to create something transformative—and I’m excited to bring that philosophy to every project I tackle.
